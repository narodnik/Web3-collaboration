# DarkWallet

## Project Description
* This is our proposal for an anonymous multi-crypto wallet which anonymizes currency on a side chain system. Over the last year we have created a cryptographic scheme that has zcash tier anonymity (without requiring fixed amounts like other darkpool schemes) but uses far simpler math. We're also developing a mixnetwork which provides superior network level anonymity than Tor. Our plan is to combine this into an anonymizing mixer wallet.
* This is good for the ecosystem because everybody is focusing the wrong sector
  of the market. The real driving usecase of cryptocurrency is not a replacement
  for credit cards, but an even older market outside control of the state being
  brought into the digital realm. This will empower millions of the world's
  disenfranchised to be able to compete with capitalist nations that have a
  stranglehold on finance and capital.
* We need a sidechain system to store values unique to our subsystem. Polkadot
  can fit this role perfectly.
* We are committed to anonymizing technologies since many years.

## Development Roadmap
* Initial prototype for this funding is the crypto scheme, a sidechain
  implementation and a UI front end written in Flutter.
* Step 1. Finish prototype in Python for review by cryptographers
* Step 2. Adjust scheme and parameters as needed.
* Step 3. Design code layout
* Step 4. Write code core (either in C++ or Rust).
* Step 5. Write sidechain subsystem and server to access data from it.
* Step 6. Integrate subsystems
* Step 7. Integrate initial UI
* These steps will take an estimated 6 months or less.
* We require 100k EUR for all of these steps and delivery of a prototype.

Also helpful to know: what are the teamâ€™s long-term plans and intentions after the grant has been awarded?

* Geopolitical focus on applying crypto technologies around the world.
* Diversification into a range of crypto projects, decentralized, anonymous and uncensored.
* Training academies for young developers.


## Additional Information

* We have developed the crypto scheme and started work on the initial Python
  test code.
* No one has contributed to this project.
* We have not applied to any grants.
* There are no other projects on this level.
* Our crypto scheme is as anonymous as ZCash but far simpler to understand.
